# Alda REPL

Alda comes with an interactive REPL (**R**ead-**E**val-**P**lay **L**oop) that
you can use to play around with its syntax. After each line of code that you
enter into the REPL prompt, you will hear the result.

> Using the Alda REPL requires that you have an Alda server running. If you
> haven't already started the Alda server, you can do so by running `alda up`.

To start the Alda REPL, run:

    alda repl

At the REPL prompt, you can either enter Alda code, or use one of the available
built-in commands, which start with a colon.

For a list of available commands, enter `:help`.
