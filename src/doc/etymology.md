# Etymology

Alda was originally named after [Yggdrasil][yggdrasil], the venerated tree of Norse legend which held aloft the mythical nine worlds. Dave thought it to be a fitting name, imagining the realm of sound/music to be an immense tree bearing numerous branches which could represent genres, tonalities, paradigms, etc.

By incredible coincidence, [the company Dave works for][adzerk] uses Norse
mythology as a theme for naming their software projects, and there was a working
project called Yggdrasil. Dave was never totally happy with Yggdrasil as the
name for his music programming language (it's a mouthful), so he took this as an
opportunity to rename it.

*Alda* is [Quenya][quenya] for "tree."

There is a plethora of music software out there, but most of these
programs tend to specialize or "reside" in at most one or two different realms
-- [FamiTracker][famitracker] and [MCK][ppmck] are specifically for the creation of NES
music; [puredata][pd], [Csound][csound] and [ChucK][chuck] are mostly useful for
experimental electronic music; [Lilypond][lilypond], [Rosegarden][rosegarden], and
[MuseScore][musescore] can be used for more than just classical music, but
their standard notation interface suggests a preference for classical music;
[Guitar Pro][guitarpro] is targeted toward the creation of guitar-based music.

Why not have one piece of software that can serve as the Great Tree that
supports all of these existing worlds?
